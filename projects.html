          <h3>End-to-end SaaS implementations &amp; C-level alignment</h3>
          <p class="meta">Mapistry · Solutions Engineer · 2025–2026</p>
          <p>Owned customer implementations as technical and project lead. Business need: scalable, low-risk go-lives and clear value for compliance decision-makers. Delivered 700+ sites with ~30% faster time-to-go-live and &gt;95% data completeness; aligned internal and C-level stakeholders on scope and outcomes. Drove proof-of-value and technical evaluations, translating platform capabilities into business impact (~45% PoV-to-contract conversion, $500K qualified pipeline).</p>

          <h3>Data ingestion strategy &amp; API-led onboarding</h3>
          <p class="meta">Mapistry · Solutions Engineer · 2025–2026</p>
          <p>To reduce implementation risk and manual errors, championed REST API integrations for data ingestion and validation. Outcome: 1000+ records/month automated, ~40% less manual effort, ~60% fewer data errors, and a repeatable onboarding playbook. Positioned onboarding as change management—training and enablement took monthly active usage from ~35% to ~75% in 90 days and cut post-launch support by ~25%.</p>

          <h3>Metrology analytics &amp; ML for defect classification</h3>
          <p class="meta">Intel · Automation Engineer · 2025</p>
          <p>Aligned metrology strategy with operational goals: move from multi-day defect queues to near-real-time insights. Implemented Python-based analytics over 4M+ records (~30% efficiency gain) and owned SPC strategy for early deviation detection. To scale classification and free engineering capacity, led the decision to deploy ML; designed, trained, and deployed Random Forest models for wafer defect classification, improving accuracy and reducing manual review by ~40%.</p>

          <h3>SQL pipelines, Power BI &amp; maintenance cost strategy</h3>
          <p class="meta">Intel · Process Engineer · 2023–2025</p>
          <p>Reporting gaps were affecting maintenance decisions and EPA compliance. Designed and owned SQL pipelines for 800+ tools (50% faster reporting) and built Power BI dashboards as single source of truth for maintenance KPIs—full fleet coverage, 40% fewer unmaintained machines reported to EPA. Led a cross-functional cost initiative: process monitoring and inventory optimization delivered 30% maintenance cost reduction ($1.2M/year) while maintaining compliance. Root cause and trend detection eliminated tool downtime in Q4.</p>

          <h3>AI chatbot for SOPs &amp; knowledge access</h3>
          <p class="meta">Intel · Process Engineer · 2023–2025</p>
          <p>Identified that technician efficiency was limited by access to SOPs and tool documentation. Led the initiative to deploy an AI-powered chatbot for retrieval and standardization of procedures, improving technician efficiency and aligning practices across the organization.</p>
