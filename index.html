      <h1>About</h1>
      <p class="role">Semiconductor · Process &amp; Automation · UC Berkeley M.S. Chemical Engineering</p>
      <p>
        My background is in the <span class="highlight">Fuzzy Front End</span> of semiconductor manufacturing at Intel—bridging R&amp;D and high-volume scalability. I focus on Total Cost of Ownership (COO) for vacuum systems, automated compliance for 400+ tools, TSV (Through-Silicon Via) process validation, and reducing technical and financial risks during technology transfer. I also bring experience from <span class="highlight">Mapistry</span> (SaaS) in technical implementation and stakeholder alignment. I frame every initiative in terms of business drivers, compliance, and impact on processes and outcomes.
