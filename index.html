      <h1>About</h1>
      <p class="role">Semiconductor · Process & Product Strategy · UC Berkeley M.S. Chemical Engineering</p>
      <p>
        My background is in <span class="highlight">semiconductor manufacturing</span> at Intel—process engineering, metrology automation, data pipelines, and ML in the fab. I left the industry for a short period to join <span class="highlight">Mapistry</span> (SaaS) and deliberately build skills in project management, C-level negotiation, and cross-functional delivery, with the objective of returning to semiconductors in a <strong>project management or product management</strong> capacity. I frame every initiative in terms of business drivers, stakeholder alignment, and holistic impact on processes and outcomes.
